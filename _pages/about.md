About Me
------
I am Zihan Yang, currently a sophomore student in the Intelligent Science and Technology program ([Zhi Class](https://zhi-class.ai)) at Peking University. Serving as the Vice President of the Academic Committee of Intelligence Science and Technology(ZhiXueHui).  

My primary research interest lies in **Embodied AI**, focusing on how intelligent agents can learn and interact with physical environments through sensory-motor experiences. I believe that true intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment, and I am excited to contribute to this rapidly evolving field.  

I enjoy playing the guitar,kicking the shuttlecock,playing table tennis,and chatting with people.
